### **Join the Challenge!**

On May 28, China’s largest retailer, [JD.com](http://jd.com/) kicked off the Global Optimization Challenge (GOC). This is a great opportunity to collaborate with partners from all over the world to develop innovative optimization technologies and smart supply chain solutions. The challenge runs through September.

### **Background**

With the availability of an unprecedented amount of data, supply chain operations are required to become increasingly personalized, efficient and flexible. Data-driven decision making technology is enabling the development of innovative supply chain solutions. [JD.com](http://jd.com/), China’s largest retailer, is launching the Global Optimization Challenge to connect business, technology and global industry talent to chart the future of smart supply chain development.

Today, customers are extremely sensitive to service quality. In order to achieve an unparalleled level of customer service, supply chains must be efficient, adaptable and agile. Engineers and researchers must develop solutions that can predict the sales accurately, place orders timely and correctly, and deliver goods to customers quickly and cost effectively.

As the world's first operations research and optimization competition focusing on smart logistics and smart supply chain, GOC has invited **leading professors from Tsinghua University, MIT, Georgia Tech and UC Berkeley to provide input and serve as judges**. Moreover, JD will provide **numerous real data** based on the company's unique full-scenarios, full-process operational experience. The outstanding contestants can earn not only from a grand **award pool totalling** **25K USD**, but also a potential **career opportunity in JD.com.**

### **Competition Tracks**

The 2018 GOC has two competition tracks:

- **Smart Inventory Control of Distribution Network:** Focuses on optimizing the transfer of inventory from its origin to JD's Regional Distribution Centers to deliver goods to customers as fast as possible. The objective is to optimize replenishment and transshipment decisions to minimize total inventory costs.

**The first round of the GOC commenced on May 28th, the second round of the competition will begin in July and the final defense will be held late September.** This is a great opportunity to collaborate with partners from all over the world to develop innovative optimization technologies and smart supply chain solutions.
